# Gamified Computer Graphics Learning App

## Overview

This repository contains a prototype application designed to gamify the teaching of Computer Graphics to Higher Education students. The app focuses on 3D Modeling using a polygonal mesh as the initial concept. Students progress through a skill tree, unlock new concepts, and develop their understanding.

## Features

1. **Skill Tree**: Concepts are organized in a skill tree, allowing students to build upon previous knowledge. Each concept unlocks new abilities.

2. **Concept Exposition**: Real-time control elements enable students to manipulate time (advance and regress exposition) and space (adjust point of view).

3. **Exercises as Quests**: Students complete exercises related to each concept. A progress bar provides feedback, and instant corrections are given upon completion.

4. **Sandbox Environment**: Unlocked concepts can be experimented with in a sandbox environment. Students can freely explore and apply what they've learned.
